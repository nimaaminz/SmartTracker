# SmartTracker

Gazelle Solar and Autonomous Car Team Test Project

## Overview

SmartTracker is a project developed by the Gazelle Solar and Autonomous Car Team. The project aims to implement a smart tracking system using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. This project is currently in the testing phase.

## Features

- Lane Detection: Algorithms to detect lanes on the road.
- Camera Settings: Configurations for camera settings to optimize object detection.
- YOLO AI Object Detection: Detects road objects when the car and simulator are running.
